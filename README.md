# GraphRAG Projects and Resources

This GitHub organization collects relevant projects and resources like the [pattern catalogue](https://graphr.ag) ([repository](https://github.com/graphrag/graphrag.github.io/tree/main/src/content/docs/reference)) and more.

*Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)* is a way to ground Large Language Models (LLMs) in factual data to avoid and reduce hallucinations.
The user's question will be used to _retrieve_ relevant information from one or more data sources.
These facts are then _augment_ together the question as the only ground truth source of information in the context to the LLM to to _generate_ the answer.

GraphRAG are _retrieval_ mechanisms that use graph structures to provide more fine-grained and relevant contextual information than a plan text search (or vector search) would. As it can utlize the rich representation of knowledge about many areas in a *knowledge graph*.
